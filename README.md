# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Price Prediction Using Random Forest

This project applies supervised machine learning techniquesâ€”specifically **Random Forest** and **Decision Trees**â€”to predict agricultural crop prices using historical data.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal is to build a predictive system that accurately forecasts crop prices by analyzing a dataset spanning five years. The project considers external influencing factors such as:
- Market demand
- Government policies
- Geopolitical events
- Meteorological conditions (rainfall, temperature)

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Techniques

- **Algorithms Used**: Random Forest, Decision Tree
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and feature engineering using a custom preprocessing pipeline
- **Model Storage**: Serialized using `joblib` as `.pkl` files
